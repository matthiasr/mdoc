# man page redirector

This is a special-case link shortener for manual pages. It was written by [Constantine A. Murenin](http://mdoc.su/), this is a port to the Bazooka platform.

## Why?

Because I need to look up manpages a lot, wanted to practice porting to Bazooka (especially classic `configure && make && make install` apps) and why not?

## What next?

* OS X
* maybe a default OS
* figure out a way around nginx' case-insensitive matching on OS X
